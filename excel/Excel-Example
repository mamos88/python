Excel Example

I have been assigned the task of ranking and reporting on the best foosball
players based on data input into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. I am given
a spreadsheet containing a players name, the shot they attempted and whether
a goal was scored.  

I know the data was collected by individuals watching the foosball game in some
cases the observer didn't pay attention to the shot so they didn't record the
shot data.

My task is to create two worksheets and populate as follows:

Worksheet 1: Player Rankings
Column A: Player Name, Column B: Total Goals Scored

Worksheet 2: Shot Rankings
Column A: Shot Name, Column B: Total Goals Scored
